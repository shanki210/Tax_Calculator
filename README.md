# Tax Calculator

This is a simple tax calculator web application that allows users to calculate their tax based on their income and age.

## How to Use

1. Input your gross annual income, extra income (if any), select your age group, and enter applicable deductions.
2. Ensure that you provide valid numerical inputs in the respective fields.
3. If there are any validation errors, error icons will be displayed next to the input fields. Hover over these icons to view error messages in tooltips.
4. Click on the "Calculate Tax" button to see the tax calculation results in a modal.
5. The modal will display the final taxable income and the amount of tax to be paid based on the provided inputs.

## Tax Calculation Formula

The tax calculation is based on the following formula:

- If the overall income (after deductions) is under 8 Lakhs, it is not taxed.
- For income over 8 Lakhs:
  - 30% for people with age < 40
  - 40% for people with age ≥ 40 but < 60
  - 10% for people with age ≥ 60
